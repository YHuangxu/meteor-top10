I really like the drag a lot, and also the asigned cute profile pics.
It's a great design that you have a crate new button on a seperated page instead of mixing with the existing ones.

But with all the rankings with different length and different number of comments, it looks crowded and not easy to read.
If all the rankings can be better aligned so that the "rank" buttons can be on one line, and may be with categories or search function or pagination, 
the website will look nicer!
